Accompanying spreadsheet (InstrumentMetadata.xlsx) gives intervals of instrument data collection for each instrument.  Set aside distinctive intervals to block out times of continuous “good” data without interference or malfunction effects.

-- Spreadsheet fields --
Site = name of field deployment location
Date = date of field deployment interval
StartTime = local time for beginning of instrumental record interval
EndTime = local time for end of instrumental record interval
InstrumentType = Type of instrument (useful for distinguishing processing required)
Instrument = universal variable name(s) for instrument
Variables = universal variable names(s) recorded by instrument
StartHeight_m = height (m) of instrument as measured at beginning of interval
EndHeight_m = height (m) of instrument as measured at end of interval (use same height if it was not measured)
HeightErr_m = estimated error (+/-) in meters for stated instrument height
HeightRef = 0 if height is relative to ground.  Otherwise, equals name of distance instrument to be used to compute height
Longitudinal_m = downwind displacement of instrument (in m)
Spanwise_m = spanwise displacement of instrument (in m)
AngleErr_deg = angle of mismatch (in deg) between orientation of setup and actual wind.  Positive angle corresponds to shift of wind toward positive y according to right-hand rule.  Note that values in table are not corrected (i.e. assume perfect alignment of setup with wind), so script is required for subsequent correction of these values
ErrorCode = 1 if a major problem is detected with instrument during time interval

-- Coordinate scheme --
x is streamwise (positive downwind)
y is spanwise (positive according to right hand rule, to right if looking upwind)
z is vertical (positive up)
Orientation of setup (upwind direction) is 290 degrees (WNW)
Campbell sonics set such that u is positive downwind, v is positive to NNE
RM Young sonics set such that u is negative downwind, v is negative to NNE
